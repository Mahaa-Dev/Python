## Sum of Square total

The `sum of squares total`, also known as the total sum of squares (`TSS`), is a measure of the total variation in a set of data. It is used in statistical analysis to quantify the total amount of variation in a dependent variable, and is used as a basis for calculating other measures of variation such as the explained sum of squares (ESS) and the residual sum of squares (RSS).

The TSS is calculated as the sum of the squares of the differences between each data point and the mean of the data. Mathematically, it can be represented as:

```
TSS = Σ(y_i - y_mean)^2
```

where `y_i` is the value of the dependent variable for the ith data point, and `y_mean` is the mean of the dependent variable.

The TSS provides a baseline measure of the total variation in the data, and is used in various statistical models, such as regression analysis, to quantify the amount of variation that is explained by the model and the amount of variation that is left unexplained. The explained sum of squares (ESS) represents the amount of variation in the data that is explained by the model, while the residual sum of squares (RSS) represents the amount of variation in the data that is left unexplained. The TSS can be partitioned into the ESS and the RSS, and is a measure of the goodness of fit of the model.

### what is variation

Variation is a measure of the dispersion or spread of a set of values. It describes how much the values in a set differ from each other, and can be used to describe the distribution of a variable. Variation can be quantified in different ways, such as by using measures of central tendency, such as the mean, median, or mode, or by using measures of dispersion, such as the range, variance, or standard deviation.

The range is the simplest measure of variation and is defined as the difference between the largest and smallest values in a set of data. The variance is a more sophisticated measure of variation and is defined as the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean of the data. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance and provides a measure of the average distance of each data point from the mean.

Variation is an important concept in statistics because it provides a way to describe the distribution of a variable and to compare different sets of data. By understanding the variation in a set of data, it is possible to make inferences about the population from which the data was sampled, and to make predictions about future values of the variable.

## Sum of Squares regression

The sum of squares regression, also known as the explained sum of squares (ESS), is a measure of the variation in a dependent variable that is explained by a statistical model. It is used to quantify the amount of variation in the dependent variable that is accounted for by the model, and is a measure of the goodness of fit of the model.

The ESS is calculated as the sum of the squares of the differences between the predicted values of the dependent variable and the mean of the dependent variable. Mathematically, it can be represented as:

```
ESS = Σ(y_i - ŷ_i)^2
```

where `y_i` is the observed value of the dependent variable for the ith data point, and `ŷ_i` is the predicted value of the dependent variable for the ith data point.

The `ESS` is compared to the total sum of squares (TSS), which represents the total amount of variation in the dependent variable, to obtain the residual sum of squares (RSS), which represents the amount of variation in the dependent variable that is left unexplained by the model. The ratio of the ESS to the TSS is known as the coefficient of determination, or R-squared, which provides a measure of the proportion of the variation in the dependent variable that is explained by the model.

In summary, the sum of squares regression is a key concept in statistical analysis and is used to evaluate the fit of a statistical model. The ESS provides a measure of the amount of variation in the dependent variable that is accounted for by the model, and is an important factor in determining the overall quality of the model.
