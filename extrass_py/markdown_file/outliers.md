## Outliers

`Outliers` are data points in a dataset that lie outside the overall pattern or distribution of the data. Outliers can occur for a variety of reasons and can have a significant impact on the results of a data analysis. In some cases, outliers may indicate errors in the data collection process or errors in the measurement of the data. In other cases, outliers may represent legitimate observations that are significantly different from the majority of the data.

There are several methods for identifying and dealing with outliers in a dataset, including:

1. `Visual inspection`: A scatter plot or box plot can be used to visually inspect the data and identify any data points that lie outside the overall pattern.

2. `Z-score`: The Z-score of a data point is the number of standard deviations it is away from the mean of the data. Data points with a Z-score that is significantly different from 0 can be considered outliers.

3. `Interquartile range (IQR)`: The IQR is the range between the first quartile (25th percentile) and the third quartile (75th percentile) of the data. Data points that lie outside the range defined by the IQR can be considered outliers.

4. `Mahalanobis distance`: This is a statistical measure of the distance between a data point and the mean of the data, taking into account the covariance structure of the data. Data points with a large Mahalanobis distance can be considered outliers.

Once outliers have been identified, there are several methods for dealing with them, including:

1. `Removing outliers`: This involves removing the outlier data points from the dataset. This can be appropriate if the outliers are due to errors in the data collection process or measurement.

2. `Replacing outliers`: This involves replacing the outlier data points with a value that is more representative of the overall pattern of the data. This can be appropriate if the outliers are due to legitimate observations that are significantly different from the majority of the data.

3. `Keeping outliers`: This involves keeping the outlier data points in the dataset and taking them into account when performing data analysis. This can be appropriate if the outliers are important observations that should not be excluded from the analysis.

The choice of how to deal with outliers depends on the specific problem and the goals of the analysis. It is important to carefully consider the nature of the outliers and their potential impact on the results of the analysis before making a decision on how to deal with them.

In general, cost functions that use absolute errors, such as the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), tend to be more robust to outliers than cost functions that use squared errors, such as the Mean Squared Error (MSE).

This is because the absolute value in the MAE function makes it less sensitive to extreme values or outliers, while the squaring of the errors in the MSE function can amplify the impact of outliers.

Another option is to use a hybrid cost function, such as the Huber loss, which combines the strengths of both MSE and MAE. The Huber loss is less sensitive to outliers than MSE, but more sensitive to outliers than MAE.

In summary, the choice of a robust cost function depends on the nature of the data and the goals of the analysis. It is important to carefully consider the potential impact of outliers on the results before choosing a cost function.
